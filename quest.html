            <h2>Quasar</h2>
            <p>Quasars are the brightest stellar objects in the Universe, outshining entire galaxies. They're powered by supermassive 
            Black Holes actively accreting material. Unlike stars, Quasars generate energy through accretion, making them incredibly luminous.<br>
            Quasars differ from Black Holes in their visibility and activity. While Black Holes are invisible, Quasars are bright and visible from great distance, being the brightest stellar object in the Universe!<br>
            In contrast, the Great Attractor is a region of space affecting galaxy motion, whereas quasars are distant, bright objects with no direct impact on galaxy motion.<br>
            On the other hand, White Holes are hypothetical objects that are essentially the opposite of Black Holes, emitting matter and energy instead of absorbing it. While Quasars are obeserved in the distant Universe, White Holes remian purely theoretical and have yet to be directly observed. If you are more interested in White Holes you can serach in the search bar above which will give you many White Holes related topics.

            <h2>Sun</h2>
            <p>The Sun is the nearest star to Earth, located about 93 million miles (149.6 million kilometers) away. As the center of our solar system, it's the primary source of light and energy for our planet. In comparison, Betelgeuse, a red supergiant, is about 640 light-years away, while Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun, is approximately 4.24 light-years away. Meanwhile, Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's center, is about 26,000 light-years away. The Sun's proximity and stability make it an ideal star for life to thrive on Earth.</p>

            <h2>Lord Of The Rings</h2>
            <p>J1407B, nicknamed the "Lord of the Rings," is a massive exoplanet known for its extraordinary ring system, comprising 37 rings that stretch across 180 million kilometers. In comparison, Saturn's ring system spans about 420,000 kilometers. While Saturn is a gas giant in our solar system, J1407B orbits a star 420 light-years away. Kepler-22B and Kepler-452B, both exoplanets discovered by the Kepler space telescope, are smaller and more Earth-like, with Kepler-452B often referred to as "Earth's cousin." J1407B's massive size and ring system make it a unique and fascinating discovery in the exoplanetary world.</p>

            <h2>Centrifugal Force</h2>
            <p>Centrifugal force is not actually a force, but rather an outward motion caused by the Sun's gravitational pull. This motion keeps planets in orbit, balanced by the inward pull of gravity. In contrast, magnetism is a force that attracts or repels charged particles. Viscous force is a resistance to motion caused by friction within fluids. Tension force, on the other hand, is a force that stretches or pulls apart objects. While these forces have distinct effects, centrifugal motion plays a crucial role in maintaining the orbits of planets, including Earth, around the Sun.</p>

            <h2>First Space Odyssey Trip</h2>
            <p>Yuri Gagarin made history on April 12, 1961, by becoming the first person to embark on an odyssey trip into space, orbiting the Earth aboard the Vostok 1 spacecraft. This pioneering achievement paved the way for future space exploration. In comparison, Neil Armstrong was the first person to set foot on the Moon in 1969. Sunita Williams, an Indian-American astronaut, holds the record for the longest spaceflight by a woman. Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet cosmonaut, was the first woman to fly in space in 1963. While these space travelers achieved remarkable milestones, Gagarin's inaugural journey into space remains a landmark moment in the history of space exploration.</p>

            <h2>Biggest Planet in the Solar System</h2>
            <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant that dwarfs all other planets in terms of size and mass. With a diameter of approximately 142,984 kilometers, Jupiter is more than 11 times the diameter of the Earth. In comparison, Saturn, another gas giant, is slightly smaller with a diameter of about 116,460 kilometers. Venus, on the other hand, is a rocky planet with a diameter of approximately 12,104 kilometers, making it one of the smallest planets. The Sun, the center of our solar system, is the largest celestial body, but it's a star, not a planet, with a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers. Jupiter's massive size and stormy atmosphere make it a unique and fascinating planet in our solar system.</p>

            <h2>Boundary Of the Earth's Space</h2>
            <p>The Karman line, named after Theodore von Kármán, marks the boundary of the Earth's space, approximately 100 kilometers (62 miles) above the Earth's surface. This line represents the edge of space where the atmosphere becomes too thin for aircraft to generate lift, and the escape velocity from the Earth's gravitational pull is achieved. In comparison, the Exosphere, the outermost layer of the atmosphere, extends from about 500 to 10,000 kilometers (310 to 6,214 miles) above the Earth's surface. The Roche Limit, on the other hand, is the distance within which a celestial body, like a moon, will break apart due to the gravitational force of the parent body. The Magnetosphere, a region surrounding the Earth, protects the planet from the solar wind and harmful radiation, extending from about 1,000 to 60,000 kilometers (621 to 37,300 miles) above the Earth's surface. The Karman line serves as a critical boundary, marking the transition from the Earth's atmosphere to outer space.</p>

            <h2>Point of No Return</h2>
            <p>The Event Horizon is the point of no return around a black hole, marking the boundary beyond which anything that enters cannot escape. Once crossed, the gravitational pull is so strong that even light is trapped, and the object is inevitably drawn towards the singularity. In comparison, the Singularity is the very center of the black hole, where the density and curvature of spacetime are infinite. The Photon Sphere, a region around a black hole, is where the gravitational pull is so strong that photons are trapped in orbit. The Accretion Disc, a swirling disk of hot, dense gas, surrounds the black hole and feeds it material. While these components are all part of a black hole's structure, the Event Horizon is the critical boundary that marks the point of no return, beyond which anything that enters is trapped forever.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational Time Dilation</h2>
            <p>According to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, time is indeed said to be bent in the presence of a black hole. This phenomenon, known as gravitational time dilation, occurs due to the intense gravitational field of the black hole. The stronger the gravitational field, the slower time passes. This means that time appears to slow down near the event horizon of a black hole, and even more so as you approach the singularity. In fact, time appears to almost stand still at the event horizon, relative to observers farther away from the black hole. This mind-bending effect has been predicted by Einstein's theory and has been confirmed by various observations and simulations.</p>

            <h2>A Spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 20km/s. If it needs to increase it's speed by 30% to enter into orbit around a planet, what will be it's new speed?</h2>
            <p>To find the new speed, we'll calculate 30% of the current speed and add it to the current speed.<br>

Current speed = 20 km/s<br>

Increase in speed = 30% of 20 km/s<br>
= 0.3 x 20 km/s<br>
= 6 km/s<br>

New speed = Current speed + Increase in speed<br>
= 20 km/s + 6 km/s<br>
= 26 km/s<br>

So, the spacecraft's new speed will be 26 km/s.</p>
